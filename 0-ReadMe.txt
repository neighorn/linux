This directory houses tools developed and provided by Martin Consulting Services, Inc. ("MCSI").
The contents of this directory are for the use of MCSI and its clients.  Licensing
is according to the terms of the contract between MCSI and this client.  Under
no circumstances does the client have ownership or exclusive use of the 
material made available in this directory.

In general, software in this directory is not copied to other directories, as
that prevents installing updates as needed.  Instead, symbolic links are 
placed in other directories (e.g. /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl)
referring back to files in this directory tree.
