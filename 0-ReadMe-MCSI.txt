The contents of the mcsi-linux repository houses tools developed and provided by
Martin Consulting Services, Inc. ("MCSI").  The contents of this repository are
for the use of MCSI and its clients.  Licensing is according to the terms of the
contract between MCSI and this client.  Under no circumstances does the client
have ownership or exclusive use of the material made available via this repository.

In early applications, this repository was checked out directly into /usr/local.
Newer installations check this repository out into /usr/mcsi-linux, and then 
add symbolic links in the appropriate directories to individual files as needed.
This newer structure reduces clutter in /usr/local/sbin, for example, to just
the code needed for the individual site.
